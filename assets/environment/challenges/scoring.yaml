  - name: survival_time_median
    short: Survival time
    description: |
      This is the median survival time. The simulation
      is terminated when the car goes outside of the road
      or it crashes with an obstacle or pedestrian.
    order: higher-is-better
    discretization: 0.1

  - name: driven_lanedir_consec_median
    short: Traveled distance
    description: |
      This is the median distance traveled, *along a lane*.
      (That is, going in circles will not make this metric increase.)

      This is discretized to tiles.
    order: higher-is-better
    discretization: 0.1
